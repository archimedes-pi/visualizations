# visualizations
Various mathematical visualizations of long strings of numbers compiled in C and possibly other languages.

Here is the test bed for several explorations into graphical representations of equations and recursive functions. 
I have a math background, but I would not call myself a mathimatician.  I'm probably reinventing the wheel, but I found several relationships that I can't explain.  Maybe someone else can explain them.

This is just a placeholder.  The code will be coming soon.  Sorry if my spelling is bad.  I will clean it up later.
